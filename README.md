# ETL Project
Group project in this original repository https://github.com/saharalaei/Flights-and-Covid-19-Pandemic

With the airport data and the flight data, we plan on joining them on the column origin. These are the queries we decided as a group to extract from the tables using PostgreSQL. By keeping a large portion of the original raw data, we will be able to obtain more precise information in the next part of the project.
